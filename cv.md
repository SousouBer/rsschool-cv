## About me

I am highly motivated to learn Web-development, specifically Front-End for now. I love designing websites and the way they are built. I surely get a lot of fun out of 
it. It is one of my goals to become a full-stack developer in the future and I'll try to do everything I can to achieve it to the best of my abilities! The internet is 
by far the best place to learn from, and I'm incredibly lucky to have such an opportunity. I currently study the bachelors degree of Physics.
